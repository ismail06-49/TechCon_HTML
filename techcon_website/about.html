            <h3>The Origins and Evolution of TechCon:</h3>
            <p>
                TechCon, one of the world’s leading technology conventions, began in the mid-1980s in Silicon Valley. Originally a small gathering of engineers and tech enthusiasts, the first event in 1984 attracted just a few hundred attendees, focusing on early computer hardware and software innovations. Companies like IBM and Apple showcased new personal computers, marking the start of TechCon's rise as a tech industry hub.
                <br>
                During the 1990s, as consumer electronics exploded, TechCon grew significantly, featuring devices like PDAs, early mobile phones, and gaming consoles. Software companies also gained prominence, with Microsoft’s Windows 95 and the internet’s rise drawing massive attention.
                <br>
                The 2000s saw the dot-com boom and bust, with startups and major players like Google and Amazon shaping the convention’s direction. Apple’s iPhone announcement in 2007 became a pivotal moment, setting the stage for the mobile tech revolution.
                <br>
                By the 2010s, TechCon embraced social media, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, reflecting the rapid growth of these sectors. The convention became a platform for major announcements from companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.
                <br>
                Today, TechCon is a global event, showcasing innovations in AI, quantum computing, blockchain, and sustainable technology. With a focus on the future of tech, the event continues to shape the industry’s direction and remains a crucial platform for technological breakthroughs.
